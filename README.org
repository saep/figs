#+title: saep's configs

* Installation
Configuration files managed with [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]].

To build the home manager configuration for the user `saep` on the computer `monoid`:

#+begin_src bash
./config build monoid saep
#+end_src

The [[./config.sh][config.sh]] scripts tries to automatically detect the username and hostname, so no arguments are required for me.

The configuration can be installed by running `result/activate` or by passing `install` as the first paraemter to [[./config.sh][config.sh]].
